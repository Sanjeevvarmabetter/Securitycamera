# Enhancing Security Camera with Blockchain Technology
the next phase of this security camera is to add principles of blockchain technology.
The goal would be to enhance data integrity, security, and transparency in the recorded footage and system processes.

# Timestamping and Immutable Recordkeeping:
Use blockchain's inherent timestamping capability to record the exact time when each piece of footage is captured. 
This ensures that the recorded data cannot be Tampered with or manipulated retroactively.
Each video/image can be treated as a transaction in the blockchain.

# Decentralized Storage:
Store the actual footage in a decentralized file storage system like IPFS. 
Instead of relying on a centralized server, the footage will be distributed across the network,
making it more resilient to attacks and failures.

# Smart Contracts:
Implement smart contracts that govern the interaction between the security camera system and the blockchain. 
These contracts can define rules for adding new footage, verifying data integrity, and managing access permissions. 
For instance, a smart contract can ensure that only authorized cameras can add footage.
